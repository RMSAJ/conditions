/* in kotlin we use return tybes for our variavles, however there are some cases we want functions that deosn't
return anything similar to (void) in kava which is the (unit) return type we use it only in some situsntions like when
a player makes an input and we call the (unit) type function to display a message
 */
/* the another practial function that alot professional developers use which is the (todo function), its usage is
 indicated by the developer in the name of the function to inform him that the function is not yet completed or need
 to be rechecked
 */
// example below
private fun myFavNums(){

     TODO()    print(" I'm still thinking about what is my fav numbers")
